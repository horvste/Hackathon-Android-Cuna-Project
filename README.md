Hackathon-Android-Cuna-Project
==============================

Hackathon-Android-Cuna-Project was written at the UWW Hackathon. The code was fairly clean until the SQL kept throwing exceptions. Following the SQL problems we were scrambling to get a working product. The code is very messy and needs major refactoring. We know that maintainability and extendability are the most important aspects of writing code, however this code is neither maintainable or extendable.
